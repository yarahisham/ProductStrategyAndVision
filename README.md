**Knolwdge Officer [Product Mangment Track]: Product Management Fundamentals -> _Product Strategy & Vision_**

Congratulations! You have been hired at Snapchat as a Product Lead. The company’s main customer set for so long has been teenagers but studies have shown that teenagers are not the best paying customers. So, Snapchat is moving on! They have a new business vision; they want more customers engaged with the app from the 25-35 age group.

As product lead, what’s your new product vision? How will you achieve it? Are there any product changes that need to be made? And if yes, can you place them in order of priority? The CMO expects a presentation from you outlining your new product vision, strategy, and high-level priorities.

- Guidelines:
  - The presentation should not exceed 15 slides.
  - Present your vision in a way that compels the audience– it’s much better if you can express it in a story format.
  - Your product strategy should cover the following points:
    - The new product’s value proposition and differentiator
    - The new product’s features by order of priority
    - The new product's design & branding (optional)
